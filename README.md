Hi 👋, I'm Avinash Kumar — passionate about open source contribution and full-stack development.

I'm a Pre-Final Year student at MNNIT Allahabad, building scalable web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I actively contribute to open-source projects, practice DSA and system design, and explore DevOps tools like Docker, CI/CD, and cloud deployment to build production-ready systems.
